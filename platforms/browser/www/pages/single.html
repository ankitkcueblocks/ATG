                                <p>Okra grows best in soil with a near-neutral pH between 6.5 and 7.0. The soil should be loamy, crumbly and well drained. Apply a layer of mulch 4 to 8 inches high. You should also side-dress the plants with 10-10-10, aged manure, or rich compost (Â½ pound per 25 feet of row). You could also apply a balanced liquid fertilizer monthly.</p>
